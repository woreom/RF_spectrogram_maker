    """
    Processes raw signal data files (.dat) to create a structured dataset of signal samples and spectrograms.

    This function searches for .dat files within the specified `base_path` using the provided `patterns`.
    For each found file, it:
    1. Loads the signal data.
    2. Extracts drone metadata from the filename.
    3. Calculates processing parameters (sample size, window size).
    4. Creates a subdirectory within `dataset_path` named after the drone model.
    5. Calls `save_samples_from_recording` to extract, process, and save signal samples
       and their corresponding spectrograms into the model-specific subdirectory.
       Metadata for each sample is temporarily stored in a JSON Lines file ('tmp.json').
    6. After processing all files, it loads the aggregated metadata from 'tmp.json'
       and saves it into a final 'meta_data.json' file in the `dataset_path`.
    7. Removes the temporary 'tmp.json' file.

    Args:
        base_path: The root directory containing the raw .dat files or subdirectories with .dat files.
        patterns: A list of glob patterns to find .dat files relative to `base_path`.
        dataset_path: The root directory where the processed dataset (samples, spectrograms, metadata) will be saved.
        sampling_rate: The sampling rate of the signal data in Hz.
        sample_time: The duration of each extracted sample in seconds.
        step_time: The time step (overlap) between consecutive samples in seconds.
        fft_size: The FFT size used for spectrogram generation.
        num_fft_spec: The number of FFT segments to include in each spectrogram.

    Returns:
        A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the metadata for one processed sample,
        loaded from the final 'meta_data.json'. Returns an empty list if no files are processed or
        if critical errors occur during metadata loading/saving.

    Raises:
        Prints error messages to the console for issues like:
        - Failure to create directories.
        - Errors loading .dat files.
        - Errors during sample processing or saving.
        - Errors reading/writing metadata files.
